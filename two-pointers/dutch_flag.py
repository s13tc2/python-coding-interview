# Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. Y

# The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
# and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

# Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
# Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]

# O(N) time | O(1) space
